# Metro Counter
A project to experiment with some JavaScript.
## Motivation
This is the first project that is part of the [Full JavaScript Course for Beginners]( https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/full-javascript-course-for-beginners/) offered by FreeCodeCamp.. This series is taught by [Per Borgen]( https://scrimba.com/teachers/perborgen) founder of [Scrimba.com]( https://scrimba.com/) and can also be found on [YouTube]( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=freecodecamp). This course is an introduction into the basics of JavaScript and offers some coding exercises and challenges along the way. The Metro Counter is a very simple counter, but for a much better understanding of the lessons taught during this project follow the links above to get the full description.
